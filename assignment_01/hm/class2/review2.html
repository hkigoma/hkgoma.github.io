  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
  <p>Cute design, minimalistic with a single horizontal movement feature, no scrolling down.</p>

  <h3>USABILITY</h3>
  <p>A but hard to understand, the info bar is represented by a red dot, no intuitive instinct to view it as a potential information bar. You kind of want to scroll down, but can’t so you feel a bit “constricted” in your movement. Using the website on a smartphone is a better experience as we are programmed to just swipe instinctively.</p>

  <h3>CONTENT</h3>
  <p>All projects are shown directly on the main page, which is good but you feel like that is the only thing they’re presenting except for their description on top.<p>

  <h3>CREATIVITY</h3>
  <p>Orignal, but simple. Could have a bit more movement or features to make it even more interesting. The way pictures are showing up when we select a project is a nice touch to make it more interactive.</p>
