  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
  <p>Lots of movement, typography is nice but could have a better hierarchy.</p>

  <h3>USABILITY</h3>
  <p>A bit hard to understand at first, but you quickly learn how to navigate. Would probably be too hard for someone older to use.</p>

  <h3>CONTENT</h3>
  <p>The content is relevant but could be placed better or separated in different pages instead of a constant scrolling to access certain info.</p>

  <h3>CREATIVITY</h3>
  <p>Original design, not something you usually see in other websites but is similar to other design company.</p>
