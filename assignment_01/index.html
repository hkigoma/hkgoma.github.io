        <h2>what</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Hillary worked on different types of project, such as re-designing new applications and working with other creatives on the look of a whole store and merchandising it to fit the aesthetic of certain fashion brands. She gets her inspiration from different aspects of the typical Montrealer lifestyle such as great architecture, the smell of good coffee, greenery, summer nights in the Old Port, the city unique fashion scene and its cultural diversity.</p>
